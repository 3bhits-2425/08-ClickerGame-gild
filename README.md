# Reflection

I used AI to generate a creative background image and a tooltip text for my Unity clicker game. I asked for a calm, dark background, and also for a humorous tooltip like "Click me like you mean it!". I added the image to the UI as a background and the tooltip appears when hovering over the button.

The AI content helped make the game more fun and visually interesting. I had no problems during the project, and the given timeline worked perfectly for me.
